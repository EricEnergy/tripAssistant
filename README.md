# Trip Assistant
https://ericenergy.github.io/tripAssistant_Project/
## Introduction
This application was developed with the purpose of creating a tool that will be helpful for any person that will be travelling to a place that they may not be familiar with.
It leverages existing third party APIs to provide the user with information that may be relevant for it’s upcoming trip.
Additionally, it utilizes the browser’s as a database to save their data; thus, avoiding the need for external data storage such as physical or cloud servers.
